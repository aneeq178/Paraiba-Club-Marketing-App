Real Estate Marketing app

## Getting Started

I created this App during my internship for a Real Estate Company to collect data of the visitors and their interest in different sectors of Real Estate. Moreover, this project has two screens one is the form for data collection and the other is the home or dashboard displaying the information about Paraiba club.


## This Project includes the following flutter concepts:
1. Firestore
2. State Managment (Using Provider).
3. FLutter animations

Architecture used:
 Model View Controller: MVC
